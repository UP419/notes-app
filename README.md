1. database - i used cloud database (cloud.mongodb.com), 'mongodb+srv://usr2:usr123@cluster1.sdis6ve.mongodb.net/node-auth' is connection string/ I use two tables (one for users and another for notes).
2. security - I use jwt for user authentication and authorization ( user login, sign in and logout is fully implemented)

3. user can sign in with new account or log in. they can add new notes, delete their notes or see notes created by any user ( but can only delete their notes).
